# Note
If you are using a **service account** for this exercise, make sure that the Terraform service account includes the *Project IAM Admin*, *Secret Manager Admin*, and *Cloud Run Admin* roles.

You also need to ensure that the *IAM Service Account Credentials API* is enabled and that you have the *Service Account Token Creator* role.

If you encounter any issue, try running it in the *Cloud Shell* first.
